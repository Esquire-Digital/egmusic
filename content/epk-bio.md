**PERFORMING ARTIST**

Emily Gabriele, commonly known as, “EG”, is an NYC-based singer-songwriter and performing artist. Her music is pop infused with a bit of rock – think Olivia Rodrigo meets Alanis Morissette.

She has performed live all around New York City’s vibrant music scene at iconic venues like Mercury Lounge, Pete’s Candy Store, Arlene’s Grocery, Rockwood Music Hall, and Bowery Electric. Her songs tap into multiple genres ranging from brit-pop to garage rock.

Emily released her album, Omega Man in 2022, and it has received praise from critics and listeners, alike. Her songs “[Talking to Strangers](https://open.spotify.com/track/3DTYxMNKxi43TSgm1vUr8z?si=83f97758674848c0)” and “[Freedom](https://open.spotify.com/track/409sTdjcg4AoZZNdjtMFKD?si=31f4329efee24a30)” both charted in the top 200 on Triple A radio.

Most recently, she signed songs to APM Music Library and has taken trips to both Nashville and LA to showcase her music in a variety of ways – from playing festivals & writer rounds to co-writing.

**PERFORMING ARTIST**

Emily Gabriele, commonly known as, “EG”, is an NYC-based singer-songwriter and performing artist. Her music is pop infused with a bit of rock – think Olivia Rodrigo meets Alanis Morissette.

She has performed live all around New York City’s vibrant music scene at iconic venues like Mercury Lounge, Pete’s Candy Store, Arlene’s Grocery, Rockwood Music Hall, and Bowery Electric. Her songs tap into multiple genres ranging from brit-pop to garage rock.

Emily released her album, Omega Man in 2022, and it has received praise from critics and listeners, alike. Her songs “[Talking to Strangers](https://open.spotify.com/track/3DTYxMNKxi43TSgm1vUr8z?si=83f97758674848c0)” and “[Freedom](https://open.spotify.com/track/409sTdjcg4AoZZNdjtMFKD?si=31f4329efee24a30)” both charted in the top 200 on Triple A radio.

In Spring 2024, she signed songs to APM Music Library and showcased her music through performances at festivals, writer rounds, and co-writing sessions in Nashville and Los Angeles.

Recently, she has been steadily releasing singles, with ""[Calling Me Back](https://open.spotify.com/album/2c9HuFr2ZfkmQ6RWjkWyce?si=5OpOHiHqTQ2tHR2yVSqyIQ)" and "[Straight Through the Night](https://open.spotify.com/track/59SL2ZRWvAzibIJS29Grxx?si=f24f25d50dc24479)" both landing in the Top 200 on Triple A radio. In addition to her own music, she is writing for other artists. Most notably, she co-wrote the song "[Girlfriend](https://open.spotify.com/track/1fUfS46EyeLHNMvlpjEv5W?si=e9b4c4922b044406)" with performing artist MELA, which was placed in the feature-length film To Love A Narcissist. The film made its global debut at the Socially Relevant Film Festival in NYC in March 2025.

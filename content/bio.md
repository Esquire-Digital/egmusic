title: Jersey Soul. NYC Blues.
---

Emily Gabriele, commonly known as “EG”, is a singer/songwriter hailing
from central New Jersey – if you believe there is a central Jersey. As
a teenager, she taught herself the guitar. Drawing from influences
like The Beatles, Bill Withers, Fleetwood Mac & John Mayer, her music
is infused with blues roots and a soulful feel.

EG currently resides in New York City and frequents Los Angeles &
Nashville. With travel as a constant in her life, inspiration runs
rampant. She released her first project, the "EG EP", in the Spring of 2013. Since then she’s been steadily writing songs that stylistically tap into multiple genres.

Her most recent project, "Special Delivery", has a tracklist comprised
of 8, personal & catchy tracks. EG recorded the project in a small
studio in East Williamsburg, Brooklyn with producer & musician,
Matthew Basile. Working closely alongside Basile & fellow
singer/songwriter Gregg Allen, the project is a compilation of
heartfelt earworms.

# PERFORMING ARTIST

Emily Gabriele, commonly known as, “EG”, is a NYC-based singer-songwriter and performing artist. Her music is pop infused with a bit of rock – think Olivia Rodrigo meets Alanis Morissette.  

She has performed live all around New York City’s vibrant music scene at iconic venues like Pete’s Candy Store, Arlene’s Grocery, Rockwood Music Hall, and the Bowery Electric. Her songs tap into multiple genres but have a home rooted in pop. 

EG recently released her sophomore album, _Omega Man_, on May 27, 2022. It's available wherever you listen to mustic.

# PERFORMING ARTIST

Emily Gabriele, commonly known as, “EG”, is a NYC-based singer-songwriter and performing artist. Her music is pop infused with a bit of rock – think Olivia Rodrigo meets Alanis Morissette.  

She has performed live all around New York City’s vibrant music scene at iconic venues like Pete’s Candy Store, Arlene’s Grocery, Rockwood Music Hall, and the Bowery Electric. Her songs tap into multiple genres but have a home rooted in pop. 

Emily is currently gearing up to release her new album, Omega Man, on April 8, 2022. She’s supporting the release with a concert at the Bowery Electric on Saturday, April 9. 2022.

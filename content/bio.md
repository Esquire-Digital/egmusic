Emily Gabriele commonly known as “EG” is a singer/songwriter hailing from central New Jersey– if you believe there is a central Jersey. As a teenager, she taught herself the guitar. Drawing from influences like Alanis Morissette, Stevie Nicks, Sheryl Crow and The Beatles her music is pop infused with a bit of rock. 

EG currently resides in New York City and frequents Los Angeles & Nashville. With travel as a constant in her life, inspiration runs rampant. She steadily writes songs that stylistically tap into multiple genres, but have a home rooted in the pop genre.

Her most recent project, "Special Delivery", has a tracklist comprised of 8, personal & catchy tracks. EG recorded the project in a small studio in East Williamsburg, Brooklyn with producer & musician, Matthew Basile. Working closely alongside Basile & fellow singer/songwriter Gregg Allen, the project is a compilation of heartfelt earworms.

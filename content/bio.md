# PERFORMING ARTIST

Emily Gabriele, known artistically as EG, is a New York City–based singer-songwriter and performing artist whose sound blends pop hooks with a rock edge—think Olivia Rodrigo meets Alanis Morissette. A regular presence in NYC’s vibrant live music scene, EG has performed at iconic venues like Mercury Lounge, Pete’s Candy Store, Arlene’s Grocery, Rockwood Music Hall, and Bowery Electric.

Her music spans genres, pulling from Brit-pop, garage rock, and indie influences. EG’s 2022 debut album Omega Man received critical acclaim, with standout tracks “[Talking to Strangers](https://open.spotify.com/track/3DTYxMNKxi43TSgm1vUr8z?si=83f97758674848c0)” and “[Freedom](https://open.spotify.com/track/409sTdjcg4AoZZNdjtMFKD?si=31f4329efee24a30)” both landing in the Top 200 on Triple A radio.

Over the past year, EG has released a steady stream of singles including “Calling Me Back” (which also charted on Triple A radio), “Straight Through the Night,” “One Way,” and “In the Room.” In Spring 2024, she signed multiple tracks to APM Music Library, who called her “_one of the most prolific artists in the New York scene today._”

EG also co-wrote a song for fellow NYC artist MELA that was placed in the indie feature film To Love A Narcissist, which premiered globally at the Socially Relevant Film Festival in Spring 2025. She continues to collaborate, perform, and travel to music hubs like Nashville and Los Angeles, showcasing her artistry through live shows, festivals, and writing sessions.
